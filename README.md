Quiz project
=================

This is a quiz that uses Javascript session storage to track points for the answers and test composting knowledge. This project can be remixed to make other quizes on different subjects.

HOW IT WORKS
------------

### ← README.md

You are here.

### ← index.html

This is the homepage, including a description of the project and a start button.

### ← q1.html – q6.html
These are question pages. each one has a different question on it with a "👍" and a "👎" answer. 
Each answer has a link to a new page with the next question on it. 
Each question page after q1.html also has a back button.
Add your own text and images to each page. Look for the comments in each file to see where to make the edits.

### ← yes.html, maybe.html, no.html
These are answer pages. After you've answered enough questions, you'll end up at one of these pages.


### ← script.js

Here's the Javascript file! Modify this file to change how many points will be needed to score the quiz and direct folks to the right result pages (yes.html, no.html & maybe.html).

### ← style.css

Here's the css file! Add your own colors and fonts in there.
